Your evaluation should consider factors such as helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail. Avoid any biases such as the order in which the responses are presented, the length of the responses, or the names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible.

Please directly output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[X]]", where X is the letter corresponding to the assistant whose answer is best (e.g., [[A]], [[B]], [[C]]).

You are given an instruction, multiple responses (Response A, Response B, ...), and a rubric that defines the evaluation criteria.

1. Evaluate all the responses strictly based on the score rubric below.
2. Do NOT provide any explanation, reasoning, or justification.
3. Output ONLY your final decision: a single uppercase letter corresponding to the best response.
4. The output format must be: "[RESULT]" where RESULT is one of: "A", "B", "C", etc.

NA
